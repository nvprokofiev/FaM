Mobile app chalenge for Shopiwy Winter internship 2020.
I was trying to build the app using Clean Architecture.

This is slighly modified classic memory game where an user should match a certain number of card by fliping them.

I have add some logic to make the game more fun. 
There are 3 difficulty levels when the user should match 2, 3 or 4 cards. I.e. playing the first level on start the user has 20 cards and 20 flips to find pairs. Every match gives 2 flips bump (depends on level).
